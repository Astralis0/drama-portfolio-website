There is spontaneity and freedom in the approach, allowing the activity to develop naturally without constraints.I was able to be creative in my approach to my work in class, particularly in the bit of adding sentences of the internal monologue to our Still Scenes from the previous class.I learned that I know a lot more that I previously realised and that I am not as bad as I thought I was with coming up with dialogue.<br>I can try to retain everything I’ve learned and pay closer attention to the show that we’ll be attending on <a data-href="Monday the 15th" href="calendar/september-2025/monday-the-15th.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Monday the 15th</a>, next week.]]></description><link>calendar/september-2025/monday-the-8th.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Calendar/September 2025/Monday the 8th.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 22:01:59 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Monday the 15th]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a href=".?query=tag:Day" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#Day">#Day</a> On Monday the 15th of September 2025, we saw a dress rehearsal of the Musical Into the Woods.<br>

The production that we attended in Gorey Little Theatre is no exception to that, the amazing team of set designers, actors, costume designers, musicians and make-up artists did a brilliant job at bringing this show to life.

If no one is interested and passionate about working together and making a project come to life, they won’t be able to work well together. In addition to this I think it’s important for the members of the group to be of similar age/generation as this tends to have members being of the same culture and being able to connect easier. I also think in order for a creative project to be brought to life, the members need to have similar weight in the decision of what the work/project they’ll be doing will be.]]></description><link>calendar/september-2025/wednesday-the-3rd.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Calendar/September 2025/Wednesday the 3rd.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 20:06:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Thursday the 11th]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a href=".?query=tag:Day" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#Day">#Day</a> <br>(The aforementioned stage plan can be found in my Physical Portfolio, or alternatively <a data-href="here" href=".html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>)C1: “This idiot has no idea what’s coming to him.

C1, in a kind of high and mighty mock voice: 'He said 'Go in and bring back the boy and the girl unharmed' and yet here lies the boy, dead on the floor.
