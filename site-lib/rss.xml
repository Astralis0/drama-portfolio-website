<br>The Shadow of a Gunman by Sean O'Casey is a drama set during the Irish War of Independence, we follow Donal Davoren, he's a poet but everyone that knows him seems to think he's an IRA "Gunman", but he is not. He stays with Séamus Shields in a room in tenement housing, in the same building as several other characters that appear within the play. One of said characters, Mr Maguire, leaves a bag in the room, at the start of the play, like a Chekov's Gun<a data-footref="1" href="#fn-1-f32bafd4f0bcee9b" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a> I suppose, but instead of a gun that has to be fired by the third act, it's a bag that has to be opened by the end.
When Donal sees that everyone actually thinks he's a "Gunman" he plays into it, enjoying the attention and the air of mystery that it lends him, he calls himself "The Shadow of a Gunman" in a serious voice when he's alone in a scene. Another character, Minnie Powell, is the love interest of Donal, and falls in love with Donal, partially over him being a "Gunman" despite him not being one.
Eventually this act of being a "Gunman" comes back to bite him for two reasons, a tenant from a neighbouring tenement, James Gallogher, comes to him with Julia Henderson asking for the IRA's help, and he gives Donal a letter. Another tenant of the tenement is Tommy Owens, a character that had showed up praising Donal and his involvement with the IRA. He sings out the window about the IRA and the "RA" which probably had some weight in the "Black and Tans" conducting a search of the tenement housing.
And this is where our little Chekov's Bag comes to fruition, Donal and Séamus, check around the room to see if there's anything incriminating, the pair check the bag and realise it's full of bombs, Minnie takes them and hides them in her room because they won't search her room. Donal also remembers the letter which he frantically searches so he can burn it and get rid of it. Eventually the "Black and Tans" arrive and search the place, making a mess. After searching the building they arrest Minnie and take her away, but their wagon is ambushed by the IRA and she's shot.Personally I really enjoyed the drama, it's very entertaining and surprisingly tense, a lot of the humour still lands despite it being written a century ago. I really liked the use of lighting with the spotlights which were used sparingly, but when they were used they were very impactful, as well as with the Sun and Moon as physical objects that could be seen on the stage, it really helped with the immersion. The set design overall was fantastic, it looked lived in and real, rather than some artificial location, which is only made possible because of the singular location that is used throughout the drama. I also loved the way the wall split to show the stairway when the characters were looking out into it, that was very clever. The accents and facial expressions were very on point, they were extremely well done and put together. We only saw a recorded version of the show but I wouldn't be opposed to seeing a live performance. <br><a data-href="Terminology#Chekov's Gun" href="terminology.html#Chekov's Gun" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Terminology &gt; Chekov's Gun</a><a href="#fnref-1-f32bafd4f0bcee9b" class="footnote-backref footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">↩︎</a>

Chekov's Gun is a plot device that once introduced, must have significance later on in the story. It comes from the Russian playwright Anton Chekov who gave the advice about including such plot devices, with the famous line, "One must never place a loaded rifle on the stage if it isn't going to go off." This is where the "Gun" part of Chekov's Gun comes from. A Tableaux Vivant, also known as a still scene or a living picture, is a method of telling a story with no moving parts, all of the actors are perfectly stationary.

Etherville by Eamonn Colfer is a short drama that we have studied. It details the story of the main character Elliot Dunne, a car accident victim who's quite severely disabled, barely able to do much with his legs and being confined to a wheelchair. He lives in an assisted living community for disabled people. A nurse and friend of his, Gail !Surname visits him to check up and make sure he's following his recovery plan.The titular place, Etherville, is a digital place in the virtual world, it's an open source project meaning that anyone can add to it and design things for it, allowing it to flourish and for individuals to escape from the harsh reality that many live in. One of these people that use it to escape from their own harsh reality is Elliot, allowing him to escape his disabilities and live freely in a world where he can walk around in once more. In the first scene where we see him using the headset, we see him and Sophie !Surname dancing gracefully to Tchaikovsky's Waltz of The Flowers. After they finish dancing ****We did a number of things based on the play including:
<br>A Tableux Vivant<a data-footref="1" href="#fn-1-f32bafd4f0bcee9b" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a>,
A 1 Minute Performance
<br>We were put into groups of three on the 26th of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="September 2025" data-href="September 2025" href="calendar/september-2025/september-2025.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">September</a>, my group consisted of:
Myself
Alex O'Brien
Oliver Fagan<br>
Alex had really wanted to be the director for the group but because there was no two male characters in a scene she couldn't, so Oliver volunteered himself, I had no particular interest in being the director anyways so that's what we went with. Alex and I were both actors for our work and Oliver was the director. On the 2nd of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="October 2025" data-href="October 2025" href="calendar/october-2025/october-2025.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">October</a> we performed our pieces, starting with the Tableaux and then the 1 Minute Performance.
<br>The Tableux Vivant<a data-footref="1" href="#fn-1-f32bafd4f0bcee9b" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1-1]</a> that we chose to do was one of the still shots from the opening scenes, specifically the one where Gail is looking for Elliot's emergency alert button and Elliot is just looking defeatedThe scene that we elected to do for our one minute performance was the ending scene of the drama, where Elliot is walking using crutches and has gained a happier stance in stark contrast to the beginning of the play.
For the performance we used a number of props to help bring the story to life, which were a set of crutches, a music box and some tables and a chair to build the set.
When deciding the section of the play we wanted to do, we all flicked through the scripts we were given and individually chose a scene, we then took the three scenes we'd chosen and then decided which of them to do. Me and Oliver had chosen the same scene, so we ended up going with that one.I think it was pretty easy to work in a group, at the beginning some people were a little reserved but after the first class and we'd all gotten into it, we worked well together and had fun. It was also nice to work in a smaller group rather than a massive one because it meant that individual opinions were heard and not ignored. My role as Elliot, was comprised of a lot of use of non-verbal communication as Elliot doesn't have many lines in the play apart from his monologue with Sophie. Personally I enjoyed my role because a lot of the expression and acting had to be non-verbal. For the next creative task, I think I could work a bit on rehearsing some actions and things to do while idle, such as when Gail is talking, I also could do a bit with my way of talking as I mostly stuck to my usual tone rather than something different to really embrace his character. I think that we had a pretty good performance overall and I enjoyed working with my team on this. <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Terminology > Tableaux Vivant" data-href="Terminology#Tableaux Vivant" href="terminology.html#Tableaux_Vivant_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Tableux Vivant</a><a href="#fnref-1-f32bafd4f0bcee9b" class="footnote-backref footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">↩︎</a><a href="#fnref-1-1-f32bafd4f0bcee9b" class="footnote-backref footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">↩︎</a>
