Etherville by Eamonn Colfer is a short drama that we have studied. It details the story of the main character Elliot Dunne, a car accident victim who's quite severely disabled, barely able to do much with his legs and being confined to a wheelchair. He lives in an assisted living community for disabled people. A nurse and friend of his, Gail !Surname visits him to check up and make sure he's following his recovery plan.The titular place, Etherville, is a digital place in the virtual world, it's an open source project meaning that anyone can add to it and design things for it, allowing it to flourish and for individuals to escape from the harsh reality that many live in. One of these people that use it to escape from their own harsh reality is Elliot, allowing him to escape his disabilities and live freely in a world where he can walk around in once more. In the first scene where we see him using the headset, we see him and Sophie !Surname dancing gracefully to Tchaikovsky's Waltz of The Flowers. After they finish dancing ****We did a number of things based on the play including:
<br>A Tableux Vivant<a data-footref="1" href="#fn-1-6cea8ab290c386bd" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a>,
A 1 Minute Performance
We worked in groups of three, my group consisted of:
Myself
Alex O'Brien
Oliver Fagan
Me and Alex were both actors for our work and Oliver was the director.
<br>The Tableux Vivant<a data-footref="1" href="#fn-1-6cea8ab290c386bd" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1-1]</a> that we chose to do was one of the still shots from the opening scenes, specifically the one where Gail is looking for Elliot's emergency alert button and Elliot is just looking defeatedThe scene that we elected to do for our one minute performance was the ending scene of the drama, where Elliot is walking using crutches and has gained a happier stance in stark contrast to the beginning of the play.
For the performance we used a number of props to help bring the story to life, which were a set of crutches, a music box and some tables and a chair to build the set.
We were put into our groups on the <br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Terminology > Tableaux Vivant" data-href="Terminology#Tableaux Vivant" href="terminology.html#Tableaux_Vivant_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Tableux Vivant</a><a href="#fnref-1-6cea8ab290c386bd" class="footnote-backref footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">↩︎</a><a href="#fnref-1-1-6cea8ab290c386bd" class="footnote-backref footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">↩︎</a>

The production that we attended in Gorey Little Theatre is no exception to that, the amazing team of set designers, actors, costume designers, musicians and make-up artists did a brilliant job at bringing this show to life. And it could even be seen by a blind man, that an incredible amount of love, care, time and effort went into this production.Now we only saw the dress rehearsal of act 1 on the night but it was brilliant nonetheless. During the show the team made excellent use of all sorts of techniques: The use of lighting was well done, they were still testing it while we were watching it because it was the dress rehearsal but they definitely got it spot on. Most might not have caught it but there were a couple of little soliloquies sprinkled in throughout the show. The costume design was spectacular especially for the witch, her entire face and identity was obscured till the very last moment at the end when she transforms. The set design I think was one of the best I've ever seen if not the best I've seen, creating an amazing atmosphere. The singing was brilliant as well, I have quite a fondness for musicals so that aspect of the show really spoke to me, so much that the main song with the whole cast saying "Into The Woods, dun dun Into the Woods..." has been stuck in my mind ever since. I would absolutely love to see more musicals in the future as per my aforementioned fondness of them, but I understand if this isn't possible. ]]></description><link>calendar/september-2025/into-the-woods-p1.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Calendar/September 2025/Into the Woods P1.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 21:31:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Into the Woods P2]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a href=".?query=tag:Day" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#Day">#Day</a> Into The Woods by James Lopine, in my opinion is a fantastic show and needs to be watched/attended.
