The reflection for this show can be found in the <a data-href="Into the Woods P2" href="calendar/september-2025/into-the-woods-p2.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Into the Woods P2</a> file, or below if the embedding feature works.Into The Woods by James Lopine, in my opinion is a fantastic show and needs to be watched/attended. The production that we attended in Gorey Little Theatre is no exception to that, the amazing team of set designers, actors, costume designers, musicians and make-up artists did a brilliant job at bringing this show to life. And it could even be seen by a blind man, that an incredible amount of love, care, time and effort went into this production.Now we only saw the dress rehearsal of act 1 on the night but it was brilliant nonetheless. During the show the team made excellent use of all sorts of techniques: The use of lighting was well done, they were still testing it while we were watching it because it was the dress rehearsal but they definitely got it spot on. Most might not have caught it but there were a couple of little soliloquies sprinkled in throughout the show. The costume design was spectacular especially for the witch, her entire face and identity was obscured till the very last moment at the end when she transforms. The set design I think was one of the best I've ever seen if not the best I've seen, creating an amazing atmosphere. The singing was brilliant as well, I have quite a fondness for musicals so that aspect of the show really spoke to me, so much that the main song with the whole cast saying "Into The Woods, dun dun Into the Woods..." has been stuck in my mind ever since. I would absolutely love to see more musicals in the future as per my aforementioned fondness of them, but I understand if this isn't possible. ]]></description><link>calendar/september-2025/into-the-woods-p1.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Calendar/September 2025/Into the Woods P1.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 21:31:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Into the Woods P2]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a href=".?query=tag:Day" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#Day">#Day</a> Into The Woods by James Lopine, in my opinion is a fantastic show and needs to be watched/attended.
