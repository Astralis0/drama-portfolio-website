It details the story of the main character Elliot Dunne, a car accident victim who's quite severely disabled, barely able to do much with his legs and being confined to a wheelchair. He lives in an assisted living community for disabled people. A nurse and friend of his, Gail !Surname visits him to check up and make sure he's following his recovery plan.The titular place, Etherville, is a digital place in the virtual world, it's an open source project meaning that anyone can add to it and design things for it, allowing it to flourish and for individuals to escape from the harsh reality that many live in. One of these people that use it to escape from their own harsh reality is Elliot, allowing him to escape his disabilities and live freely in a world where he can walk around in once more. In the first scene where we see him using the headset, we see him and Sophie !Surname dancing gracefully to Tchaikovsky's Waltz of The Flowers. After they finish dancing ****We did a number of things based on the play including:\n<br>A Tableux Vivant<a data-footref=\"1\" href=\"#fn-1-6cea8ab290c386bd\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>,\nA 1 Minute Performance\nWe worked in groups of three, my group consisted of:\nMyself\nAlex O'Brien\nOliver Fagan\nMe and Alex were both actors for our work and Oliver was the director.\n<br>The Tableux Vivant<a data-footref=\"1\" href=\"#fn-1-6cea8ab290c386bd\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1-1]</a> that we chose to do was one of the still shots from the opening scenes, specifically the one where Gail is looking for Elliot's emergency alert button and Elliot is just looking defeatedThe scene that we elected to do for our one minute performance was the ending scene of the drama, where Elliot is walking using crutches and has gained a happier stance in stark contrast to the beginning of the play.\nFor the performance we used a number of props to help bring the story to life, which were a set of crutches, a music box and some tables and a chair to build the set.\nWe were put into our groups on the <br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Terminology > Tableaux Vivant\" data-href=\"Terminology#Tableaux Vivant\" href=\"terminology.html#Tableaux_Vivant_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tableux Vivant</a><a href=\"#fnref-1-6cea8ab290c386bd\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a><a href=\"#fnref-1-1-6cea8ab290c386bd\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<span style=\"font-weight:800; color:rgb(0, 176, 80)\">Etherville by Eamonn Colfer</span>","level":1,"id":"<span_style=\"font-weight800;_colorrgb(0,_176,_80)\">Etherville_by_Eamonn_Colfer</span>_0"},{"heading":"Contents","level":1,"id":"Contents_0"},{"heading":"<span style=\"color:rgb(0, 176, 240)\">Synopsis</span>","level":2,"id":"<span_style=\"colorrgb(0,_176,_240)\">Synopsis</span>_0"},{"heading":"<span style=\"color:rgb(0, 176, 240)\">Our Work</span>","level":2,"id":"<span_style=\"colorrgb(0,_176,_240)\">Our_Work</span>_0"},{"heading":"Tableaux Vivant","level":3,"id":"Tableaux_Vivant_0"},{"heading":"1 Minute Performance","level":3,"id":"1_Minute_Performance_0"},{"heading":"<span style=\"color:rgb(0, 176, 240)\">Reflection</span>","level":2,"id":"<span_style=\"colorrgb(0,_176,_240)\">Reflection</span>_0"}],"links":["terminology.html#Tableaux_Vivant_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"calendar/october-2025/etherville.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1759440583745,"modifiedTime":1759735819682,"sourceSize":2659,"sourcePath":"Calendar/October 2025/Etherville.md","exportPath":"calendar/october-2025/etherville.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":2,"backlinks":["calendar/october-2025/etherville.html","calendar/october-2025/october-2025.html","calendar/september-2025/september-2025.html"],"type":"markdown"},"calendar/october-2025/october-2025.html":{"title":"October 2025","icon":"","description":"<a href=\".?query=tag:Month\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Month\">#Month</a>This is the file in which all the events of October will be detailed, any of the dates that are highlighted and/or underlined can be clicked to go the file associated with that day.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Calendar","level":1,"id":"Calendar_0"}],"links":["?query=tag:Month","calendar/october-2025/etherville.html","calendar/october-2025/etherville.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"calendar/october-2025/october-2025.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1759440307491,"modifiedTime":1759440816371,"sourceSize":974,"sourcePath":"Calendar/October 2025/October 2025.md","exportPath":"calendar/october-2025/october-2025.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":3,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"calendar/september-2025/creative-groups.html":{"title":"Creative Groups","icon":"","description":"<a href=\".?query=tag:Day\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#Day\">#Day</a>I think the most crucial part of what makes a creative group work well together, is the desire &amp; passion for the work.
