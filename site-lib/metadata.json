makes a creative group work well together, is the desire &amp; passion for the work. If no one is interested and passionate about working together and making a project come to life, they won’t be able to work well together. In addition to this I think it’s important for the members of the group to be of similar age/generation as this tends to have members being of the same culture and being able to connect easier.

The production that we attended in Gorey Little Theatre is no exception to that, the amazing team of set designers, actors, costume designers, musicians and make-up artists did a brilliant job at bringing this show to life.

The singing was brilliant as well, I have quite a fondness for musicals so that aspect of the show really spoke to me, so much that the main song with the whole cast saying \"Into The Woods, dun dun Into the Woods...\" has been stuck in my mind ever since.
